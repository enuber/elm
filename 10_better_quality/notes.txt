In Elm testing, Fuzz is a way to write property-based tests â€” tests that automatically generate a wide variety of random inputs to test whether a property or behavior always holds true.

It comes from the elm-explorations/test package and allows you to test your functions more thoroughly than by just using fixed inputs.

âœ… What is Fuzz?
Fuzz is a module that provides random data generators (like numbers, strings, lists, etc.).

You use it to test a property across many random inputs instead of writing lots of manual test cases.

ðŸ§ª Example: Property Test with Fuzz.int
Letâ€™s say you want to verify that adding 0 to a number always returns the number itself:

import Test exposing (..)
import Expect
import Fuzz exposing (int)

testAddZero : Test
testAddZero =
    fuzz int "n + 0 == n" <|
        \n ->
            Expect.equal (n + 0) n


ðŸ§  What this does:
fuzz int "n + 0 == n" means:

"Generate many random integers, call each one n, and run the test body using that value."
Elm will automatically test your property with many (e.g. 100) random values for n.

ðŸ§© Other available fuzzers:
Fuzz.int	- Random integers
Fuzz.float	- Random floating-point numbers
Fuzz.string	- Random strings
Fuzz.list fuzzer - List of random values
Fuzz.tuple - Tuples of random values
Fuzz.map, .andThen - Combine fuzzers to build custom types

âœ… Summary
Concept	Description
Fuzz - A module for generating random test data
fuzz - A function that runs your test many times with random inputs
Purpose - To catch edge cases and improve confidence in function correctness
