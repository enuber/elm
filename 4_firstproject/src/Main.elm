-- this paints the information
-- when setting up onClick or any events remember to import them at the top of page
-- we updated this from data to model as that is what we are receiving
-- for the type annotation, again, the view is the Model and it is producing Html and, the Msg part is indicating that it isn't just producing Html but, it is producing it with some sort of events. 
-- fromInt makes an integer a string
-- by adding maybe to the Model above, we now need to add in a default, this way we don't get an error if no name exists.
