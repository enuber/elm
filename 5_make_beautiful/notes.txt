package.elm-lang.org

you can search for Elm UI

this is for layout and styling that can be used without using CSS


set up in terminal

elm init
 elm install mdgriffith/elm-ui

to compile
 elm make src/Main.elm

can add this in to take care of compling
npm init -y


-- can be any name 
-- This is calling the layout function from elm-ui, which is used to create the root node for rendering your Elm UI. It returns a Html msg value. options = []: These are layout configuration options. You can specify things like Element.width, Element.height, Element.padding, etc. An empty list means no custom layout options are applied.
-- [] - The second argument to Element.layout is a list of Element.Attribute items, such as styles or events. This is also empty here, so no special attributes are applied to the root element.
-- This is the content of the layout: a single text node that displays the string "My dog", wrapped in elm-ui's layout system.
viewLayout =
  Element.layout {
    options = []
  }
  []
  (Element.text "My dog")


  Element.layout
This is the simpler and more common function. Use it when you don't need custom fonts, themes, or device information. 

Element.layoutWith
Use this when you need access to custom fonts, themes, or device-related info like screen size or orientation. It takes a config record with options, onResize, theme, and font.

Element.layoutWith
  { options = []
  , onResize = Nothing
  , theme = Element.defaultTheme
  , font = Element.defaultFont
  }
  []
  (Element.text "With custom layout")

Which one should you use?
Use **Element.layout** for 95% of cases â€” it's simple and works well.

Use **Element.layoutWith** only if you need:
  to respond to screen resizing 
  a custom theme or font
  full control over layout config

  }
    @font-face {
    font-family: Typewriter;
    src: url('TYPEWR__.ttf');
  }
</style>

fontGreatVibes =

26 MD content

using lorem ipsum to fill content

adding in the view content section

since I didn't add fonts, showing what he did to add the fonts to this section

// this is basically a function where we pass in size and use it to set the top. Rather than write out the long paddingEach code over and over, this is a work around if you need to use it alot.
paddingTop size = 
  Element.paddingEach {top = size, right = 0, bottom = 0, left = 0}

viewContent = 
  Element.column [ fontTypewriter, Element.Font.size 16, paddingTop 20 ]
  [
      Element.paragraph 
        [Element.paddingXY 0 20] 
        [Element.text text1]
      , Element.paragraph
         [Element.paddingXY 0 20] 
         [Element.text text2]
      , Element.paragraph 
        [Element.paddingXY 0 20] 
        [Element.text text3]
  ]

27 MD better colors

just added more colors and reformatted how colors are putting them into a better structure

____________________________________________________________________________________

28 MD themes

creating buttons for light and dark which will change the colors based on the buttons pressed


____________________________________________________________________________________

29 MD Types

added "types" to everything in this video

____________________________________________________________________________________

30 MD imports

you can do
import Element.Font as EF 

this makes it a type alias where Element.Font can now be called by saying just EF instead. 

this means you are exposing everything
import Html exposing (..)

so now you can just say Html without having to say Html.Html or having to do import Html exposing (Html)

rule of thumb - if exposing everything (..) do this with one library not multiple libraries.

31 MD semantics

This video he uses alias to change the element. I did not do this so that the code is more readable and understandable since just learning
